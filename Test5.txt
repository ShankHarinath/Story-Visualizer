It was her first day at Cedars International School. 
Sheila was in the 2nd grade. 
She missed her old school and was quite sure that she was going to hate this new place. 
At lunch break, Junie and Pam from her class introduced themselves to her. 
They took her to a tree that stood at the corner of the playground. 
Pam asked her, “Would you like to come to the Hole of Mysteries with us?”. 
 Sheila asked astonished, “Hole of Mysteries! Where’s that?”.
Near the tree was a hole, covered with hay and sticks. “This is the Hole of Mysteries,” said Junie. 
Pam said, “Come on, let’s jump into the hole”. 
Pam, Sheila and Junie jumped inside holding each other’s hands. 
The hole became darker as they went deeper and deeper. 
Then all of a sudden it became bright. Lighted candles were everywhere. 
Sheila was frightened. 
Pam laughed seeing her. Junie pointed out to a rabbit lighting a candle. 

The Mysterious School

Pam said, ”That is Binkie the rabbit”. “She plans all our adventures.” 

Junie said, “hi Binkie!”. “This is Sheila Stevens. Do you have a mysterious adventure for us today in the mysterious school?” 

Binkie smiled and said, “Hi Sheila, welcome to the Hole of Mysteries. Girls, I only have a tiny adventure for you. It’s not easy, mind you. You have to be very alert as it’s to do with sounds. Now follow me. You have to find your way out.” Binkie went ahead. 

The girls followed her. They came to a small room. Binkie had vanished. Once they got inside, the doors locked automatically. There were three animals in the room: a cat, a dog and a fish (inside a bowl). They could hear loud grunts from outside. 

Sheila said, “I think there’s a monster nearby”, frightened. 

“We have to take the help of these animals to get out!” whispered Junie. 

“Or else we will have to stay here for ever,” said Pam. 

“How do we find our way out?” asked Sheila, feeling quite nervous. 

“Let’s think hard!” said Junie. 

Pam said, “I think I know! I think one of these animals can talk.” 

“But which one?” asked Sheila. 

“Let’s find out,” said Junie. 

“Did you notice what the animals were doing when we got here? The cat was shaking its head and scratching itself. The fish was waving its tail and the dog was thumping its tail. I feel it must be either the dog or the fish. Let’s find out.” 

Pam went up to the fish and said, “Can you help us?” The fish did not seem to have heard her and continued to wave its tail in the water. 

Then Sheila went up to the dog and said, “What’s your name?” 

“Spike” replied the dog. “If you are looking for the exit, I can help you.” 

“Can you really talk?” the girls asked the dog. 

“Yes I can,” said the dog. “Now press hard against the door and chant ‘Ashanti’ three times. When the door opens run fast until you reach the top. Don’t look back ever!” 

The three thanked the dog and as soon as they chanted ‘Ashanti’ thrice, the door opened. 

But, the grunting sounds grew louder, frightening the girls. 

They ran up the dark path, stopping only when they reached up, at the beginning of the tunnel. 

“Hey, we made it!” shouted Pam in excitement as they found back themselves in the mysterious school playground. 

“But what about the animals?” asked Sheila. 

“They are in there, perhaps helping Binkie plan our next adventure!” 

“Wow!” said Sheila. “I think I’m going to have a great time at Cedars!” 

The bell rang just then and the trio returned to their class in the mysterious school.
